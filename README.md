# Rice Image Classification using CNN

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify different varieties of rice using an image dataset.  
Originally built and trained on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/muhammadfahadbashir/practical-cnn-implementation-using-rice-images).
